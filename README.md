OpenAustralia.org
=================

This is the main OpenAustralia.org repository. The code you see here isn't interesting, it's just the submodules (which are interesting!), however this repository is used for [issue tracking](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia/issues) across the whole project.

If you're interesting in contributing code, check out these projects:

* The web application: [openaustralia/twfy](https://github.com/openaustralia/twfy)
* The parser: [openaustralia/openaustralia-parser](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser)
